# monte-carlo-pi-estimation

A simple python simulation to estimate the pi value using the Monte Carlo method.  
It randomly generates points inside a square with fitted circle and checks how many fall inside a circle. The ratio between the two gives an approximation of pi value 3.141592.

## Hot-to-Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the 'mcp.py' file.
3. Enter the number of points to generate, go above 100 for better visual.
4. It clearly shows you the both square and circle graph, and pi estimation graph separatly.

## Libraries-used
1. Random
2. Matplotlib
3. Math
